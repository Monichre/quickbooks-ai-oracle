# Purchase Order & Invoice Creation Epic

This folder contains all development tickets required to implement the **Copy Estimate → Purchase Order / Invoice** feature.


## Instructions and Development Workflow

Read **00-Overview.md** first, then **00-TODO.md**, and then pick up the lowest-numbered ticket with a **pending** or ⏳ status.

Naming convention: `XX-title.md` where `XX` is the sequence order (e.g., `16-UI-CopyToPurchaseOrderAction.md`).

Status keys: ✅ done ⏳ pending 🛑 blocked

When you have completed your work for a ticket find it in **00-Overview.md** and mark it ✅ done.
