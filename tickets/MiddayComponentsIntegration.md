# Midday Components Integration

## Overview

Enhance our invoice generation, preview, and editing capabilities by integrating open-source components from Midday (https://midday.ai/components/). These components will provide a richer, more user-friendly experience for invoice creation and management, particularly when generating invoices from estimates.

## Components

1. **Invoice PDF Template**
   - React PDF template supporting Tiptap JSON format
   - Rich formatting capabilities for professional-looking invoices
   - Customizable layout and styling
   - https://midday.ai/components/invoice/

2. **Invoice React Template**
   - Interactive invoice preview component
   - Supports Tiptap JSON format for rich content
   - Themeable design to match our application
   - https://midday.ai/components/invoice-react/

3. **Invoice Open Graph Template**
   - Next.js template for generating shareable invoice previews
   - Social media and messaging platform compatible
   - Brand-consistent presentation
   - https://midday.ai/components/invoice-og/

4. **Invoice Toolbar**
   - Collaborative editing tools with comments and avatars
   - Annotation capabilities for review workflows
   - Customizable action buttons
   - https://midday.ai/components/invoice-toolbar/

5. **Invoice Editor** (future integration, currently marked as "Coming Soon")
   - Visual drag-and-drop invoice editor
   - Highly customizable template system
   - Real-time preview capabilities
   - https://midday.ai/components/editor/

## Integration Steps

### 1. Dependency Analysis

- Identify required dependencies from Midday components
- Assess compatibility with our existing tech stack (Next.js, React, TypeScript)
- Document version requirements and potential conflicts
- Create package.json updates for new dependencies

### 2. Component Adaptation

- Create wrapper components for each Midday component
- Implement type-safe interfaces for component props
- Build data transformation utilities between our data models and Midday's expected formats
- Develop theme integration to ensure visual consistency

### 3. Integration Points

- **PDF Generation Service**
  - Replace or enhance current PDF generation with Invoice PDF Template
  - Setup server-side rendering pipeline for PDF creation
  - Implement caching strategy for generated PDFs

- **Invoice Preview**
  - Integrate Invoice React Template into the invoice creation flow
  - Add preview mode in the invoice edit screens
  - Implement responsive behaviors for various device sizes

- **Sharing Features**
  - Add Open Graph Template support to invoice detail pages
  - Implement API routes for generating invoice preview images
  - Create sharing functionality with proper Open Graph metadata

- **Collaboration Features**
  - Add Invoice Toolbar to edit screens
  - Implement user avatar and comment functionality
  - Build notification system for collaborative actions

### 4. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all wrapper components and utilities
- Integration tests for component interaction
- Visual regression tests for template rendering
- Performance testing for PDF generation
- Cross-browser compatibility tests

### 5. Documentation

- Update technical documentation with new component details
- Create usage examples for developers
- Document data model requirements and transformations
- Provide theming and customization guides

## Technical Considerations

- Server Components vs. Client Components separation
- PDF generation performance optimization
- Data transformation efficiency
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Theme consistency

## Dependencies

- Requires completion of Invoice Service Wrapper (Ticket #04)
- Should be implemented after Invoice Create page (Ticket #07)
- May require updates to the Invoice data model to support rich content

## Success Criteria

- Successfully render invoice previews using Midday components with our data
- Generate PDFs that match the design and content of the preview
- Maintain performance standards (PDF generation under 2 seconds)
- Pass all accessibility checks
- Seamless integration with our existing estimate-to-invoice workflow
