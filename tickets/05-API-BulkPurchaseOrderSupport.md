# 05 – API – Bulk PurchaseOrder Support

## Overview

Enhance the Purchase Order API wrapper to support bulk creation of purchase orders, enabling efficient processing when an Estimate maps to multiple vendors.

## Objectives

- Extend `createPurchaseOrder()` to accept and process arrays of PurchaseOrder objects
- Ensure atomicity and error handling for partial failures
- Optimize for performance and API rate limits

## Sub-Tasks

1. Update service interface to support bulk operations
2. Implement batch processing logic
3. Add error handling for partial successes/failures
4. Write comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
5. Update documentation and usage examples

## Technical Notes

- Follow QuickBooks API guidelines for batch operations
- Ensure compatibility with mapping utilities
- Log errors and surface user-friendly messages

## Success Criteria

- Bulk creation works as expected in all test cases
- Handles partial failures gracefully
- Integrates with Estimate-to-PO workflow
