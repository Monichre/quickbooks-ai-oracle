You may enter multiple categories by separating each one with a comma. |

| allAudiences | bool | | false | All Audiences |
| endUserOnly | bool | | false | Products ok to show end users only. If you are developing an end-user facing application, set this to true to remove any products that are not intended to be viewed by end users. The default is false, meaning all products will be shown. |
| popular | bool | | false | Popular items only |
| fresh | bool | | false | Fresh ideas |
| timely | bool | | false | Timely products |
| prodTime | int | | 0 | Minimum production time in working days. Leave blank or '0' for any |
| includeRush | bool | | false | Include rush shipment. The IncludeRush field should be either "Y" or "N" depending on whether or not you want to include suppliers offering rush service in your production time searches. If set to yes, all suppliers offering rush service will be included in the search results even if the normal production time is outside of the specified production time. If the ProdTime field is empty or zero, the IncludeRush parameter is ignored. |
| madeIn | string | | | Country made in. Two-digit country code |
| prefGroups | string | | | Preference Groups. The PrefGroups field ties into the preference groups assigned in SAGE Workplace. If this field is blank, all suppliers will be searched. To search only suppliers within one or more specific preference group, enter a comma-separated list of preference group ID numbers to search. The preference group ID numbers can be found in the preference group setup area within SAGE Workplace. |
| suppId | int | | | Supplier SAGE #. The supplier SAGE # is a 5-digit number that identifies a supplier. This is required for supplier users who are performing searches. |
| lineName | string | | | Specific Supplier's Line Name |
| siteCountry | string | | | Site country code (if diff from acct). SiteCountry allows you to specify a two-digit country code for the site's location. If not specified, the country code of your account will be used. The country code is used in searching to determine which products to show on the site. For example, if a supplier has a Canadian catalog and a US catalog, the catalog shown will be determined based on the site's location as specified here. |
| updatedSince | ISO 8601 UTC datetime | | | Updated since this date/time. Filters to only products that have been updated since this datetime value. This is useful to only return products that have changed since a certain time. Note that values must be entered in UTC time zone and format. For example, "2023-07-27T06:10:00Z" |
| applyPsSearchRestrictions | bool | | false | Apply PromoSearch search restriction settings. Sets whether or not the global search restriction settings from the PromoSearch Settings area will apply to this search. |

| extraReturnFields | string | | | Return additional fields in the response string. See notes tab for details |
| maxTotalItems | int | | 1000 | Max items to find (<=50000). The MaxTotalItems field sets the maximum number of products to find in a search. If this field is not included, the default value will be used. If you would like to return fewer than 1,000 matching products, use this field to set the maximum. If you would like to return more, you can set this to any number up to 50,000. You cannot return more than 50,000 products in a search. |
| startNum | int | | | Record number to start with (1=first). The StartNum and MaxRecs fields are used to return a subset of the total search results. This allows you to implement "records per page" functionality. If you do not wish to use these fields, leave both empty. However, if you do want to use this functionality, the StartNum should contain the starting record number for this request and the MaxRecs should contain the number of records to return. For example, if a search returns 110 total products and you would like to display records 1-20, you would enter "1" for StartNum and "20" for MaxRecs. Then, to show records 21-40, enter "21" as the StartNum and "20" again for MaxRecs. |
| maxRecs | int | | | Max records to return per page. The StartNum and MaxRecs fields are used to return a subset of the total search results. This allows you to implement "records per page" functionality. If you do not wish to use these fields, leave both empty. However, if you do want to use this functionality, the StartNum should contain the starting record number for this request and the MaxRecs should contain the number of records to return. For example, if a search returns 110 total products and you would like to display records 1-20, you would enter "1" for StartNum and "20" for MaxRecs. Then, to show records 21-40, enter "21" as the StartNum and "20" again for MaxRecs. |
