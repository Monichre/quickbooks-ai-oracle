## Required Fields and Data to Generate a Purchase Order from an Estimate in QuickBooks

### Necessary Fields and Data

To generate a purchase order (PO) from an estimate in QuickBooks, the following conditions and fields must be met:

- **Purchase Orders Feature Enabled**: You must turn on the purchase order feature in QuickBooks (either Desktop or Online) before creating POs from estimates[8][12].
- **Estimate Status**: The estimate must have a status of either *Accepted* or *Pending*, not *Closed*[9].
- **Line Items on Estimate**: Only line items marked as “purchased from a vendor” in your Products and Services list can be copied to a PO. Each item must have the “I purchase this product or service from a vendor” option checked in its setup[9].
- **Vendor Assignment**: When creating the PO, you must select a vendor for each item. If items on the estimate are sourced from multiple vendors, you can choose to generate separate POs for each vendor[9].
- **Other Required PO Fields**: When generating the PO, you must fill in the PO date, PO number (auto-generated), and shipping information. Each line item should have quantity, description, and price[8][12].

### What If There Are No Line Items on the Estimate?

- **No Line Items = No Purchase Order**: If your estimate does not have any line items, you cannot generate a purchase order from it. The PO generation process relies on the presence of line items that specify what needs to be ordered[6][9].
- **Best Practice**: Always ensure your estimates include specific line items for products or services you intend to order. Without these, the system has nothing to transfer to the PO.

### How to Properly Configure an Estimate

- **Add Line Items**: Enter all products and services as line items in the estimate. Use the Line Items grid to add, edit, and detail each item[6][11].
- **Mark Items as Purchasable**: In your Products and Services list, ensure each item you plan to order from a vendor is marked as purchasable[9].
- **Customer/Job Details**: Assign the estimate to the correct customer or job, and include relevant dates and descriptions[7][11].
- **Recurring Templates**: For frequently used estimates, you can create recurring transactions or templates with pre-filled line items for efficiency[10].
- **Save Your Work**: Line items are not saved until the entire estimate is saved. Always save after entering or editing line items[6].

### Other Ways to Generate a Purchase Order in QuickBooks

- **From Scratch**: You can always create a PO directly, independent of any estimate, by navigating to the Vendors menu (Desktop) or the +New button (Online), then selecting Purchase Order and filling in the required details[8][12].
- **From Bills or Expenses**: In some workflows, you can generate POs from bills or expense entries, though this is less common and typically used for back-ordering or drop shipments.
- **Using Recurring Transactions**: For regular purchases, set up recurring POs for standard items or vendors[10].
- **Manual Entry**: If your workflow does not start with an estimate, simply enter the PO manually, specifying vendor, items, quantities, and other details[8][12].
