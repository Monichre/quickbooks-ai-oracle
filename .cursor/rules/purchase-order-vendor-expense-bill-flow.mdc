# Relationship Between Purchase Orders, Vendors, Bills, and Expenses in QuickBooks

## Data Flow Relationships

The relationship between these entities forms the core of the accounts payable workflow in QuickBooks. Understanding how they connect is essential for implementing a robust purchase order system.

### Core Entity Relationships

**Vendors** are the central entity that other transaction types connect to. Each vendor can have multiple purchase orders, bills, and expenses associated with them.

**Purchase Orders (POs)** are non-posting transactions (don't affect financial statements) that represent a commitment to buy goods/services from a vendor. They serve as a precursor to either bills or expenses.

**Bills** are posting transactions that create actual financial liability (Accounts Payable) and will appear on financial statements. They can be generated from purchase orders or created independently.

**Expenses** are direct payments for goods/services that are typically paid immediately rather than creating a liability. Like bills, they can come from purchase orders or be created independently.

## User Experience Journey

From a UX perspective, the typical workflow follows this progression:

1. **Vendor Selection**: User selects or creates a vendor
2. **Purchase Order Creation** (optional): User creates a PO for the vendor
   - Specifies items/services to purchase
   - Sets quantities and prices
   - Marks the PO as "Open"
   - Sends to vendor
3. **Converting to Financial Transaction**:
   - When goods arrive, user can convert the PO to either:
     - A **Bill** (if paying later) - creates Accounts Payable
     - An **Expense** (if paying immediately) - direct expense transaction
4. **PO Status Change**: The PO status updates to reflect fulfillment
5. **Payment Processing**: For bills, a separate payment step occurs later

      └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Relationships in the ERD:

1. **Vendor to PO**: One vendor can have many purchase orders (1:many)
2. **Vendor to Bill**: One vendor can have many bills (1:many)
3. **Vendor to Expense**: One vendor can have many expenses (1:many)
4. **PO to Bill**: One purchase order can generate one or more bills (1:many)
5. **PO to Expense**: One purchase order can generate one or more expenses (1:many)
