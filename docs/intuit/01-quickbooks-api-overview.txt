# QuickBooks Online API Overview

## Introduction

The QuickBooks Online API provides a RESTful interface for developers to interact with QuickBooks Online accounting data. This powerful API allows you to create rich integrations that connect with financial data, automate accounting processes, and build custom solutions for business needs.

## Key Features

- **RESTful Architecture**: Clean, predictable API design following REST principles
- **JSON Data Format**: Modern, lightweight data interchange format
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure, industry-standard authentication
- **Comprehensive Entity Coverage**: Full access to all major QuickBooks accounting entities
- **Sandbox Environment**: Development and testing without affecting production data
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications of data changes
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple currencies and regional accounting requirements
- **Robust Error Handling**: Detailed error responses for efficient troubleshooting
- **Reliable Rate Limits**: Clearly defined rate limits with reasonable thresholds

## API Architecture

The QuickBooks Online API is organized around core accounting entities that represent the fundamental objects in the QuickBooks ecosystem. The API follows these architectural principles:

### Data Organization

- **Entities**: The API is structured around business objects like customers, invoices, and payments
- **Relationships**: Entities contain references to related objects via ID references
- **Collections**: Entities are organized into collections that can be queried and filtered
- **Operations**: Standard CRUD operations are available for most entities

### Request Structure

Requests to the QuickBooks Online API follow this general pattern:

```
https://{environment}.api.intuit.com/v3/company/{realmId}/{resource}/{optional-entity-id}
```

Where:

- `{environment}` is either `quickbooks` (production) or `sandbox-quickbooks` (sandbox)
- `{realmId}` is the company identifier
- `{resource}` is the entity type (e.g., customer, invoice)
- `{optional-entity-id}` is used for operations on a specific entity

### Response Structure

Responses from the API typically include:

- HTTP status codes indicating success or failure
- JSON-formatted response body with requested data
- Metadata such as timestamps, version information, and pagination details
- Error information when applicable

## Entity Model Overview

The QuickBooks Online API provides access to a comprehensive set of accounting entities. The core entities include:

- **Company Information**: Basic company details and settings
- **Chart of Accounts**: Financial account structure
- **Customers & Vendors**: Business relationships
- **Items & Products**: Goods and services
- **Transactions**: Various financial transactions (invoices, payments, bills)
- **Reports**: Financial and accounting reports

The entities follow a well-defined relationship model, as illustrated in the [Entity Relationship Diagram](../quickbooks-erd.svg).

## Integration Patterns

Common integration patterns with the QuickBooks Online API include:

1. **Data Synchronization**: Keeping external systems in sync with QuickBooks data
2. **Automated Transaction Processing**: Creating invoices, recording payments, etc.
3. **Financial Reporting**: Extracting data for custom reports and analytics
4. **Customer/Vendor Management**: Managing business relationships
5. **Inventory Control**: Tracking product quantities and values
6. **Mobile Extensions**: Extending QuickBooks functionality to mobile platforms
7. **Vertical Solutions**: Industry-specific applications built on QuickBooks data

## Development Workflow

A typical development workflow with the QuickBooks Online API includes:

1. **App Registration**: Registering your application in the Intuit Developer portal
2. **Sandbox Testing**: Developing and testing in the sandbox environment
3. **OAuth Implementation**: Implementing secure authentication
4. **API Integration**: Building your core integration functionality
5. **Webhook Setup**: Configuring real-time notifications (if needed)
6. **Production Deployment**: Moving to the production environment
7. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Monitoring and maintaining the integration

## API Versions

The QuickBooks Online API uses a versioning system to ensure compatibility:

- **Major Version**: Indicated in the URL path (e.g., `v3`)
- **Minor Version**: Specified as a query parameter (e.g., `minorversion=65`)

The current stable version is v3 with regular minor version updates.
