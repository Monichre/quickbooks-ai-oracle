## QuickBooks & Sage Data Integration System

### 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing a data integration system that consolidates information from QuickBooks and Sage into a unified database, with Sage serving as the authoritative data source. The system will facilitate business operations for a client operating as a middleman between multiple product vendors and service vendors, handling customer orders that translate into multiple purchase orders to different suppliers.

### 2. Product Vision

Create a robust data integration platform that seamlessly merges financial and business planning data from QuickBooks and Sage, providing a single source of truth for business operations while maintaining data integrity and supporting significant product catalog expansion.

### 3. Target Users

- Business owner/client (John) who serves as a middleman between customers and multiple vendors
- Administrative staff who manage orders and inventory
- Financial team members who handle accounting and reporting

### 4. User Stories

1. As a business owner, I want Sage data to take precedence over QuickBooks data when conflicts exist so that I can maintain consistent business operations.
2. As an administrator, I want to access a unified dataset that combines information from both systems so I can manage operations without switching between platforms.
3. As a financial team member, I want accurate data synchronization so I can generate reliable reports.
4. As a business owner, I want the system to handle significant catalog expansion (from ~200 to 20,000+ products) so I can scale operations.
5. As an administrator, I want data integrity verification during import processes to ensure accuracy.

### 5. System Architecture
