The ITEMS array in your navigation component is already correctly set up with the items you specified. I've fixed the linter errors by:

1. Adding `type="button"` to buttons in both the One and Two components
2. Changing the invalid `href="#"` to `href="/"` in the links

These changes resolve all the linter errors while maintaining your navigation structure.
